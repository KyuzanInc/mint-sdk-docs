title: Setting up and acquiring user profile information
---

import Image from "@theme/IdealImage";
import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

Using the MintSDK, we can setup and show information that is linked to the users wallet address.

## Example

On a user page, we can show user information and past transaction logs that the user has made.

<img alt="Profile Image" src={useBaseUrl("/img/userAccountInfo/profile.png")} />

<img alt="Transaction Image" src={useBaseUrl("/img/userAccountInfo/tx.png")} />

## Implementation Examples

### 1. Profile Setup

We first setup an initial UI like below.

<img alt="form" src={useBaseUrl("/img/userAccountInfo/form.png")} />

To upload an image for the profile picture, please use `sdk.uploadAccountInfoAvatar`.
If the upload is successful, it will return a Promise Resolve type with the values of `imgId`„Å®`uploadedImgUrl`.

`imgId` is an argument for `sdk.updateAccountInfo`.

`uploadedImgUrl` is an url containing the uploaded image, which can be used for preview purposes.

```typescript
const { imgId, uploadedImgUrl } = await sdk.uploadAccountInfoAvatar({ file });
```

To create and update profile information, we use the `sdk.updateAccountInfo` method.

```typescript
await sdk.updateAccountInfo({ imgId, .... })
```

### 2. Acquiring profile information

To get information from a profile, please use `sdk.getAccountInfo`. The wallet address can be set by passing `walletAddress` as an argument.

```typescript
const accountInfo = await sdk.getAccountInfo({ walletAddress: "0xxxxxxxx" });
```
