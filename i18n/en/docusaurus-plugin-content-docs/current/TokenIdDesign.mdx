title: Design regulations for tokenId
---
tokenId is an unique identifier for the NFT.
It is possible to generate and assign a identifier to an NFT.
The following are restrictions upon creating an unique identifier.

- Must be an integer
- Must be unique against the contract
- While using Mint, the max value cannot exceed `9007199254740990`


## Design proposals

Though there are no strict best practices, here are some examples of generating the tokenId.

### Basic

The very basic method is to incrementally increase the ID, `1,2,3` etc.

### Advanced
The advanced method is to split the id in to two or more parts to present further information about the item.
For example, we can create a number in which the first 6 numbers present the edition of the item, and the numbers following are the unique idenitifer of the item.
This is the method Kyuzan Inc. uses for EGGRYPTO.


#### Example

`1000001`

`2000001`

....

`21000001`

`22000001`

`1000002` <-  Illustrates edition 2 of `1000001` 

## Test item tokenId on the main net 
The main net was tested by creating items with an itemId decrementing from `9007199254740990`.
