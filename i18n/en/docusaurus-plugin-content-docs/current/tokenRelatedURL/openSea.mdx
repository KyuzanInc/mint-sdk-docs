title: Generating a OpenSea NFT Page URL
---

By creating an OpenSea page for the generated NFT, it allows for more secondary market distribution, and show the certification of the NFT more publicly.

- The contract address is `Item.mintContractAddress`
- The token ID  is `Item.tokenId`

For both `tradeType=fixedPrice` and `tradeType=auction`, the NFT is not published until it is bought or successfully auctioned.
To check whether the Item has been bought or auctioned, please refer to `Item.buyerAddress` for a value.
