title: Generating a BlockchainExplorer URL

By presenting an Etherscan URL, we can get the transaction history of an item and show it to the user.

You can get the transaction history of an item, including the `TxHash` using `SDK.getItemLogs()`.


The `NetworkId` for each item can be referenced by `Item.networkId`.

## Etherscan

For those with the `NetworkId` as `1` or `4`, the below URL can be used.
